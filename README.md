# Connect4
 
In this program, you can play connect 4 against an AI. Currently the AI is set to a ply of 6, 
meaning that it will look 6 moves ahead for possible wins and defense. A low ply means that the 
AI is easier to play against and vice versa. Currently the ply can be changed in the program code, 
but not in the user interface. The AI's time complexity is very slow, so increasing ply beyond 7 
will result in long wait times. The AI's time between moves will decrease as the game goes on.
